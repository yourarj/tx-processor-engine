# Awesome TXpro Engine 
An Awesome ðŸ˜Ž tx processor engine

Each flavour is load tested against csv file containing `~56 Million (55,999,948)` records 

Have tried multiple approaches can enabled with following features
1. ###  `csv_sync`
   - `default`
   - implemented with [csv crate](https://github.com/BurntSushi/rust-csv)
   - fastest
   - can be made even faster with `--unsafe-mode` switch (please refer --help for details)
   - > run with `cargo run -- transactions.csv > accounts.csv`
   - run with faster unsafe `cargo run -- --unsafe-mode transactions.csv > accounts.csv`
2. ### `csv_async`
   - implemented with [csv-async crate](https://github.com/gwierzchowski/csv-async)
   - run with `cargo run --no-default-features --features csv_async --bin async_tx_executor -- transactions.csv > accounts.csv`
3. ### `tokio`
   - implemented with [tokio crate](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio)
   - run with `cargo run --no-default-features --features tokio --bin tokio_tx_executor -- transactions.csv > accounts.csv`
4. ### `rayon`
5. - ### WIP
   - implemented with [rayon crate](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon)
   - run with `cargo run --no-default-features --features rayon --bin rayon_tx_executor -- transactions.csv > accounts.csv`
6. ### `arrow`
   - ### WIP
   - implemented with [apache arrow crate](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs)
   - run with `cargo run --no-default-features --features arrow --bin apache_arrow_tx_executor -- transactions.csv > accounts.csv`

Processes csv files containing transactions performed by the clients and yields the final state of all involved clients as output of the processing 

e.g. input 
```csv
type,       client, tx, amount
deposit,    1,      1,  1.0
deposit,    2,      2,  2.0
deposit,    1,      3,  2.0
withdrawal, 1,      4,  1.5
withdrawal, 2,      5,  3.0
```

expected output
```csv
client, available,  held,   total,  locked
1,      1.5,        0.0,    1.5,    false
2,      2.0,        0.0,    2.0,    false
```

## Assumptions:

- Once disputed transaction is `RESOLVED`/`CHARGEBACKED` it can't be `DISPUTE`d again
- Only `DEPOSIT` type transaction can be marked as disputed
- `DEPOSIT` / `WITHDRAWAL` of unrealistic amount (overflowing) are ignored. Has to malicious.
- `DEPOSIT` causing overflow are also ignores. Has to be malicious
- Any client with not a SINGLE valid transaction will be omitted from result.
## How To
 - Get help with  `cargo run -- --help`

 - Run with  `cargo run -- <path_to_csv_file>` 

 - Run with error to std err `cargo run -- -l <path_to_csv_file>`
  
 - Run in unsafe mode `cargo run -- -u <path_to_csv_file>`
   - thi mode almost TWICE the performance of safe mode
   - assumes the input csv has no violations of space and columns in any row 
   - any row with violations will be skipped

 - Get app version with  `cargo run -- -V`

Shinde Arjun
An awesome ðŸ˜Ž transaction processing engine

USAGE:
    tx_executor [OPTIONS] <FILE>

ARGS:
    <FILE>    path of file to process

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help           Print help information
    -l, --log-errors     Enable error logging [default: false]
    -u, --unsafe-mode    Run in unsafe mode?, considers input csv is sanitized for spaces and column
                         length. trade off between flexibility and performance. [default: false]
    -V, --version        Print version information
```
