# Awesome TXpro Engine 
An Awesome ðŸ˜Ž tx processor engine

## Assumptions:

- Once disputed transaction is `RESOLVED`/`CHARGEBACKED` it can't be `DISPUTE`d again
- Only `DEPOSIT` type transaction can be marked as disputed
- `DEPOSIT` / `WITHDRAWAL` of unrealistic amount (overflowing) are ignored. Has to malicious.
- `DEPOSIT` causing overflow are also ignores. Has to be malicious
- Any client with not a SINGLE valid transaction will be omitted from result.
## How To
 - Get help with  `cargo run -- --help`

 - Run with  `cargo run -- <path_to_csv_file>` 

 - Run with error to std err `cargo run -- -l <path_to_csv_file>`

 - Get app version with  `cargo run -- -V`
